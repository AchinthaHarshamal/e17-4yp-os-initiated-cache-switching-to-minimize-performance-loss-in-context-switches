# OS-Initiated Cache Switching to Minimize Performance Loss in Context Switches

Caches work like faster and more efficient versions of computer memory, helping to speed up operations. However, the best way to set up a cache depends on how a specific program uses memory. When switching between different tasks, the cache needs to be cleared and refilled with new data, which takes time and energy.

To make caches perform better, researchers have developed different techniques. One idea is called cache partitioning, where the cache is divided into smaller sections. When a program is running, it can choose the most suitable section of the cache to use by following special instructions. This method reduces the interference between cache data from different programs and makes task switching faster and more efficient. Ultimately, this improves overall performance and reduces the time and energy wasted during context 
switches.
